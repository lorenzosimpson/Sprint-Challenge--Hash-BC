Hash Tables / Blockchain Questions


add to beginning of array is O(n) - all elements have to be shifted over
add to end of array is O(1) 
worst case is O(n) if there are no remaining spaces:
    we have to request a new block of memory to store the array in
    we have to copy the elements and increase size

Blockchains are structures that hold blocks of information and are linked together by a hash string, which is really just a string representation of the previous block

Blocks typically have an index, a timestamp, a list of transactions that occurred while that block was being mined, and a proof (indicating that computing was done to mine that block)


Proof of work is data generated by a mining program that satisfies a condition. In our case, it means that the mining program has found a proof that, combined with our block string, produces a string whose last six digits match the first six digits of the previous proof (that somebody else might have found). This is designed to take time on the mining side, but can be easily verified by the server.

An attacker could conceivably create the longest valid chain by taking over more than half of the computing power that’s currently mining that chain. But the fact that this isn’t feasible protects the chain from being compromised.
